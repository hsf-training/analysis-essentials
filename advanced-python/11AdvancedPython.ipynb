    "We are used to control-flow elements such as `if...elif...else` blocks. However, exceptions _can_ also be used for this. They do not replace other ways of control-flow, however there are sometimes situations in which they provide a golden solution to steer the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider an `add` function that _sometimes_ can add three elements - which is, for the sake of a good example, favorable as more performant (real world cases of this exist in larger scale, but too complicated to explain here) - and sometimes not. Also assume that the `add` function is called again maybe inside.\n",
    "A solution is to execute `add` with three elements. If an error is raised, we catch it (the specific one), and run the function again with two arguments and add the third argument by calling `add` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this also solves the problem if `add` is called deeper nested again: we don't care _where_ it is called, we just try again with only two numbers. The advantage is that we don't need to check the output of the function; this will always be a number (and not a `None` or something like this)."
