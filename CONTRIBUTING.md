# Contributing

[starterkit-lessons][repo] is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds:

* New lessons;
* Fixes to existing material;
* Bug reports; and
* Reviews of proposed changes.

By contributing, you are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under [these licenses][license].
You also agree to abide by our [contributor code of conduct][conduct].

## Getting Started

1.  We use the [fork and pull][gh-fork-pull] model to manage changes.
    More information about [forking a repository][gh-fork] and [making a Pull Request][gh-pull].

2.  To build the lessons please install the [dependencies](#DEPENDENCIES).

3.  For our lessons, you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `master` branch.

4.  When editing lesson pages, you need only commit changes to the Markdown source files.

5.  If you're looking for things to work on, please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.

## Dependencies

To build the lessons locally,
create the `analysis-essentials` conda environment using [environment.yml](environment.yml)

```shell
$ conda env create --file environment.yml
```

which you can use by activating it

```shell
conda activate analysis-essentials
```

(or create an environment with the dependencies listed in the environment file
using your favorite environment manager).

Then build the pages:

```shell
$ starterkit_ci build --allow-warnings
$ starterkit_ci check --allow-warnings
```

and start a web server to host them:

```shell
$ cd build
$ python -m http.server 8000
```
You can see your local version by using a web-browser to navigate to `http://localhost:8000` or wherever it says it's serving the book.

## Contributing notebooks

Notebooks should contain no output to help keep the size of this repository manageable.
The output for each cell will be filled automatically as part of the deployment process.
