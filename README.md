# Analysis essentials [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhcb/analysis-essentials)

This is the source material for the [analysis essentials website][website], a 
series of lessons for helping high-energy physics analysts become more 
comfortable working with the shell, version control, and programming.

The lessons introduce the basics of the bash shell, the git version control 
system, and the Python programming language. They are developed for and taught 
during the [Starterkit][starterkit], and aim to teach students enough to be 
able to follow the experiment-specific lessons that are taught afterwards.

Contributions to the lessons are highly encouraged. Please see the 
[contributing guide][contributing] for details on how to participate.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [open an issue][issues] on this 
repository.
